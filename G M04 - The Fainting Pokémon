The Elite N are a number of people in a line, that you have to beat in order to be the Pokémon Champion.
Each person has exactly one Pokémon, with a predetermined power level.
When a battle occurs, the powers of both Pokémon steadily decrease until either reaches 0. This will be referred to as fainting.
You have to make sure your Pokémon doesn't faint, i.e., its power should remain > 0
You can take rest and restore your Pokémon to full power to start battling again. But it takes one day to do so.
When you rest the current opponent also takes a rest restoring his powers to full.
You can fight as many battles as possible in a day until you rest.
Find the number of days you will need to defeat the Elite N and become the champion.
Note that there might be a person stronger than you whom you cannot defeat. Hence you will have to lose.
Print the number of days required to defeat the Elite N, and -1 if you can't.
