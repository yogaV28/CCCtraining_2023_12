Alice owns a company that transports tour groups between two islands. She has n trips booked, and each trip has pi passengers. Alice has m boats for transporting people, and each boat's maximum capacity is c passengers.

Given the number of passengers going on each trip, determine whether or not Alice can perform all n trips using no more than m boats per individual trip. If this is possible, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Input Format

The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of n (number of trips), c (boat capacity), and m (total number of boats). The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the values of p0, p1, p2... pn-1

Constraints

1 <= n,c,m <= 100 1 <= pi <= 100

Output Format

Print Yes if Alice can perform all n booked trips using no more than m boats per trip; otherwise, print No.
